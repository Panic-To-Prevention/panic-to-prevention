# Panic To Prevention

1. Project Status
   Current Phase: Prototype Development
   Next key Milestone: Finalizing User Study Protocol and Prototype Integration
   
2. Project Goals
   This project explores the feasibility of using physiological biosignals from commercial wearables (HR, HRV, etc.) to predict panic or acute stress episodes before they fully manifest. It also investigates the user experience, trust, and comfort asosciated with different alert strategies.

   CORE OBJECTIVES:
   1. Predictive Accuracy: Determine if biosignals (Heart Rate, Heart Rate Variability) can reliably predict panic/stress events using threshold-based or Machine Learning models.
  2. Alert Strategy Evaluation: Determine which alert style (Self-only vs. Contact-based) provides the optimal balance of user Trust, Reassurance, and Intrusiveness.
  3. Functional Prototype: Develop a working prototype system simulating real-time signal processing and alert notification delivery.

3. Architecture Overview
  ( TO BE UPDATED )

4. Data and Security Considerations
  * Sensitive Data: The system handles real-time physiological data (HR, HRV) and information regarding mental health events.
  * Initial Security Focus: The next development phase includes a security review focused on secure data transmission, storage, and anonymization protocols to ensure participant comfort and compliance.
